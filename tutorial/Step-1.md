Step 1
======

1. First of all, to start in a reasonable way we need to create a project repositories on our [github](github.com), and then clone it, and create our first commit.
2. now we need to create a firebase project in our [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) (I asume that you have a google acount created yet)
then you create a firebase realtime database and import this json data to that.
    ```json
    {
        "folders": {
            "f": {
            "name": "fruits"
            },
            "a": {
            "name": "animals"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
3. in order to be tidy we will create a cople of branchs before start settings the aplications config.
