# GraphqlAndFirebase

**Note:** This is a first try to create a GraphQL tutorial combined with firebase as a "hosting" infrastructure.
this is based on a tutorial series from 2017 - [John Tucker](https://codeburst.io/@johntucker_48673)
 on medium, but as always, when you do a tutorial you need to changes some things or grow up others things, so, because of that I'll create a cuple of tutorial markdown files , that you can find here.
where I will put the explanations differences, and clarifications about why I chouse some changes on each tutorial step if there are any.
here below I put the John's tutorial series link if you want to do his tutorials ( spoiler alert, I did them )
